chapter 

tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars and then fell into a moody jog 
he crossed a small branch two or three times because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit 
half an hour later he was disappearing behind the douglas mansion on the summit of cardiff hill and the school house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him 
he entered a dense wood picked his pathless way to the centre of it and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak 
there was not even a zephyr stirring the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound 
but the occasional far off hammering of a woodpecker and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound 
the boy s soul was steeped in melancholy his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings he sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands meditating 
it seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best and he more than half envied jimmy hodges so lately released it must be very peaceful he thought 
to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave and nothing to bother and grieve about 
ever any more if he only had a clean sunday school record he could be willing to go and be done with it all now as to this girl what had he done nothing 
he had meant the best in the world and been treated like a dog like a very dog she would be sorry some day maybe when it was too late ah if he could only die temporarily 
but the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again 
what if he turned his back now and disappeared mysteriously what if he went away ever so far away into unknown countries beyond the seas and never came back any more 
how would she feel then the idea of being a clown recurred to him now only to fill him with disgust for frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense 
when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic no he would be a soldier and return after long years all war worn and illustrious 
no better still he would join the indians and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the far west 
and away in the future come back a great chief bristling with feathers hideous with paint and prance into sunday school some drowsy summer morning with a blood curdling war whoop 
and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy but no there was something gaudier even than this he would be a pirate that was it now his future lay plain before him 
and glowing with unimaginable splendor how his name would fill the world and make people shudder how gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas in his long low black hulled racer 
the spirit of the storm with his grisly flag flying at the fore and at the zenith of his fame how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church brown and weather beaten 
in his black velvet doublet and trunks his great jack boots his crimson sash his belt bristling with horse pistols his crime rusted cutlass at his side his slouch hat with waving plumes 
his black flag unfurled with the skull and crossbones on it and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings it s tom sawyer the pirate the black avenger of the spanish main 

yes it was settled his career was determined he would run away from home and enter upon it he would start the very next morning therefore he must now begin to get ready he would 
collect his resources together he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his barlow knife he soon struck wood that sounded hollow he put his hand there and 
uttered this incantation impressively 

what hasn t come here come what s here stay here 

then he scraped away the dirt and exposed a pine shingle he took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure house whose bottom and sides were of shingles 
in it lay a marble tom s astonishment was boundless he scratched his head with a perplexed air and said 

well that beats anything
